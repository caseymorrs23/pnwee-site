# PPC Funnel – PNW Electrical Engineering

Static PPC landing funnel for GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` – PPC landing page (noindex) with lead form
- `thank-you.html` – confirmation page
- `styles.css` – styling
- `README.md` – this file

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a folder `/ppc/` in your repo.
2. Upload these files into that folder.
3. Your page will be at `https://<your-domain>/ppc/` (e.g., https://pnwengineer.com/ppc/).

## Form Handling
- Replace the Formspree URL with your endpoint: `https://formspree.io/f/yourformid`.
- Or swap to another static form handler.
- The form redirects to `thank-you.html` after submission.

## Analytics
- Replace GA4 ID `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in `index.html`.
